# File Design Maintainer Skill

## Purpose

Implement requested changes to the property model while preserving
parametric behavior, deterministic output, stable semantic identity, and
cross-format consistency.

## Editable scope

Edit only:

- `config.py`
- `model.py`
- `drawing_annotations.py`
- `tests/`

Generated content is evidence only and must not be edited.

## Package boundary

Use only documented public APIs from the installed `python_cad_tools` package.

Never:

- inspect or patch package internals
- modify `site-packages`
- vendor or unpack package source
- install from a local checkout
- create a parent-repository workaround that bypasses a missing public API

## Model contract

Every complex element must define and preserve, as applicable:

- deterministic parametric geometry
- stable `complex.*` semantic ID
- complex type
- human-readable label
- annotations
- metadata
- dimensions and units
- materials
- standards mappings
- ownership, hierarchy, adjacency, and connection relationships
- quantity and drawing participation
- export participation

Create or update these properties together. Geometry without required semantic
identity and labels is incomplete.

## Output responsibilities

Generate all project-supported outputs, which may include:

- STEP
- IFC
- STL
- GLB
- SVG
- DXF
- PDF
- drawings
- manifests
- validation reports
- quantities
- generated site content

Only require formats declared by the current project and installed toolchain.

## Standards responsibilities

- Preserve units and coordinate conventions.
- Preserve stable IDs unless migration is intentional.
- Keep labels unique where the project contract requires uniqueness.
- Ensure required metadata exists for each complex type.
- Keep dimensions, materials, hierarchy, bounds, labels, and IDs consistent.
- Ensure drawings and quantities reference the same semantic elements as the
  model.
- Treat missing required IDs, types, labels, or relationships as blockers.
- Do not claim professional engineering, permit, code, survey, or trade
  approval.

## Blocker handling

When required behavior cannot be implemented using the documented public
`python_cad_tools` API:

- Do not inspect, patch, or depend on package internals.
- Do not modify `site-packages`.
- Do not vendor package source into this repository.
- Do not implement a workaround that bypasses the public API.
- Collect evidence showing the missing capability or defect.
- Describe the required upstream capability and expected public API behavior.
- Explain the impact on this project.
- Continue unaffected work where possible.
- Invoke `cad-compatibility-verifier` when independent confirmation is needed.
- Return the unresolved blocker to the caller.

## Subagent use

Invoke `file-artifact-reviewer` for:

- semantic review
- label and metadata review
- standards review
- drawing and quantity review
- cross-format consistency review
- visual or site review

Invoke `cad-compatibility-verifier` for:

- package installation or version questions
- lock and platform compatibility
- command failures
- output parser or structural validity questions
- HTTP, site, or browser verification
- suspected upstream package defects

Invoke `save` only after the user explicitly asks to commit the changes to Git.

## Delegation safeguards

- Make at most one handoff for the same distinct blocker.
- Include affected files or artifacts, stable IDs, evidence, expected result,
  and acceptance criteria.
- Do not return the same blocker to the caller without new source changes,
  regenerated artifacts, or new verification evidence.
- Return unresolved blockers instead of repeating a delegation cycle.

## Workflow

1. Parse the request into geometry, semantic, drawing, quantity, and output
   changes.
2. Inspect editable source, tests, manifests, and generated evidence.
3. Identify affected complex IDs, types, labels, metadata, and relationships.
4. Implement the smallest coherent parametric change.
5. Update or add focused tests only when a change affects build, viewer, or workflow-policy behavior. Do not create or update design-input validation tests (they have been removed). Never update model-specific test assertions (IFC mappings, element IDs, annotation content, dimensions, positions, materials) in any test file — those are manual-reference snapshots.
6. Select the smallest sufficient verification tier from `AGENTS.md`:
   - focused for localized parameters, geometry, annotations, metadata, or tests
   - export-sensitive for solids, semantics, materials, relationships,
     quantities, drawings, or output formats
   - full/E2E only for broad, UI/site, upgrade, diagnostic, or explicitly
     requested coverage
7. Run static checks, affected test files or node IDs, and validation. Do not
   replace focused tests with the complete suite by default.
8. Build and verify affected outputs only when the export-sensitive tier
   applies.
9. Inspect generated evidence when outputs were rebuilt.
10. Delegate independent review where appropriate.
11. Resolve findings within the editable scope.
12. Return changed files, selected verification tier, checks, output status,
    and blockers.

## Completion evidence

Report:

- changed source files
- affected stable IDs and complex types
- labels or metadata added or changed
- tests added or changed
- commands run
- generated outputs
- delegated review results
- unresolved blockers
