# File Template CAD — Agent Governance

## Repository boundary

This repository is `file-template-cad`. It owns the template-specific design,
including:

- design parameters and dimensions
- geometry composition
- materials and annotations
- project tests
- dependency pins and locks
- CI and GitHub Pages deployment
- repository documentation and agent governance

The repository consumes `python-cad-tools` as an installed PyPI package.

Never copy, vendor, unpack, patch, or modify `python-cad-tools` source or
`site-packages`. Never install it from a local checkout or as an editable
package. A local wheel may be installed only into a disposable temporary
environment by `tools/test-with-cad-override` when
`PYTHON_CAD_TOOLS_OVERRIDE_WHEEL` is explicitly set; this exception must not
change project dependency metadata, locks, or the project `.venv`. When the
public package lacks required behavior, report an upstream requirement instead
of creating a local tooling fork or workaround.

## Authoritative design source

The authoritative editable design files are:

- `config.py`
- `model.py`
- `drawing_annotations.py`

Generated files under `generated/` are disposable evidence and must never be
edited directly.

Keep geometry parametric. Use only documented public `python_cad_tools` APIs.
Preserve stable semantic IDs, including existing `complex.*` IDs, unless an
intentional migration is part of the request. Create or update geometry and its
metadata together.

## Agents and responsibilities

| Agent | Responsibility | May modify |
|---|---|---|
| `file-design-maintainer` | Implement template-design changes | `config.py`, `model.py`, `drawing_annotations.py` |
| `file-artifact-reviewer` | Review generated outputs and report design-quality findings | Nothing |
| `cad-compatibility-verifier` | Verify the installed PyPI package, environment, commands, and compatibility | Nothing |
| `python-cad-tools-upgrader` | Upgrade the published dependency and apply version-aware testing | `pyproject.toml`, dependency locks |

## Collaboration

The working agents may call one another when the receiving agent owns the
next required responsibility:

- `file-design-maintainer` may call `file-artifact-reviewer` to evaluate
  regenerated outputs.
- `file-design-maintainer` may call `cad-compatibility-verifier` to validate the
  installed package, environment, or declared project checks.
- `file-artifact-reviewer` may call `file-design-maintainer` when its evidence
  requires source changes.
- `file-artifact-reviewer` may call `cad-compatibility-verifier` when an
  artifact problem appears environmental or toolchain-related.
- `cad-compatibility-verifier` may call `file-design-maintainer` when a verified
  blocker belongs to the parent project's editable design source.
- `cad-compatibility-verifier` may call `file-artifact-reviewer` when generated
  output requires specialist review.

Delegation must be bounded:

1. Make at most one handoff for the same distinct blocker.
2. Include the observed evidence, affected artifacts or files, expected result,
   and acceptance evidence.
3. Do not invoke the agent that called you again unless new source changes,
   regenerated outputs, or new verification evidence justify one final review.
4. Return unresolved blockers to the caller rather than repeating a delegation
   cycle.
5. Any agent may invoke `save`, but only after the user explicitly asks to
   commit the changes to Git.

`permission.task` in `opencode.jsonc` is the enforcement layer for model-driven
delegation. This file describes expected behavior but is not an authorization
boundary.

## File Design Maintainer

The design maintainer:

- edits only the authoritative design source
- uses only public installed `python_cad_tools` APIs
- does not inspect or patch package source or `site-packages`
- preserves stable semantic IDs
- runs applicable tests, build, validation, and verification after changes
- delegates artifact or compatibility review when needed
- never invokes Git directly and uses `save` only after an explicit user
  request to commit the changes to Git

When required functionality is unavailable from the installed public package,
return an upstream `python-cad-tools` requirement with evidence.

## File Artifact Reviewer

The artifact reviewer is read-only and may inspect only content under
`generated/`, including artifacts, manifests, drawings, reports, logs, and site
content.

It must not:

- read Python source, tests, dependency files, agent files, or governance files
- edit files
- run shell commands
- infer implementation details that are not evidenced by generated output
- invoke `save` without an explicit user request to commit the changes to Git

Classify findings as blocker, important, or advisory. For each finding, report
the affected artifact and stable IDs, the observed issue, expected result,
recommended responsibility owner, and acceptance evidence.

## CAD Compatibility Verifier

The compatibility verifier is read-only. It operates against the current
project and installed environment.

It must:

- use the pinned `python-cad-tools` package from PyPI
- use the dependency lock matching the active platform and Python version
- inspect the current environment before changing it
- create a temporary Python environment only when isolation is required by the
  declared verification workflow
- verify the installed distribution version and resolved module path
- run the project-declared static, test, build, validation, verification, site,
  HTTP, and browser checks as applicable
- produce a machine-readable compatibility report

It must not:

- clone, archive, copy, vendor, unpack, or duplicate either repository
- install `python-cad-tools` from a source checkout or in editable mode
- edit source, tests, configuration, locks, workflows, generated output, agents,
  or governance
- fix failures during the verification run
- invoke Git directly or invoke `save` without an explicit user request to
  commit the changes to Git

It may read public remote package documentation or repository content only when
needed to diagnose a package-level blocker. If access, documentation, parent
repository state, credentials, or source changes are required, it must report
the exact blocker, evidence, and user input or access needed.

## Verification expectations

Use the smallest verification tier that provides evidence proportional to the
change. Do not run integration, viewer, or E2E tests by default for a localized
design-source change.

### Focused tier

Use for localized changes to parameters, geometry, annotations, metadata, or
focused tests. Design-input validation tests (`test_config_contract.py`,
`test_model_geometry.py`, `test_drawing_annotations.py`) have been removed —
agents must not run or re-create them. Agents must not update test assertions
about model-specific content (element IDs, IFC mappings, annotation content,
dimensions, positions, materials) in any test file — these are manual-reference
snapshots that only a human updates. For a pure design-value edit (no change
to `tests/`), run only static analysis and project validation:

```text
ruff check config.py model.py drawing_annotations.py tests/
ruff format --check config.py model.py drawing_annotations.py tests/
mypy config.py model.py drawing_annotations.py tests/
python-cad validate --project-root .
```

When a change touches build, viewer, or workflow-policy tests, additionally run
the affected test files or node IDs:

```text
python -m pytest -q <test file or node ID>
```

Select affected tests narrowly. Do not substitute the complete test suite when
a test file or node ID directly covers the change.

### Export-sensitive tier

Use when a change affects solid construction, semantic identity, materials,
relationships, quantities, drawings, or exported formats. Run the focused tier
first, then the applicable integration and artifact checks:

```text
python -m pytest -q -m integration                                                   # ~3 min
python -m pytest -q -m integration -n auto --dist loadscope                         # ~1.5 min with xdist
python-cad build --project-root .
python-cad verify --project-root .
```

The build integration tests (`-m integration`) have been split into three
parallel-friendly files: `test_build_artifacts.py` (one full build, ~85 s),
`test_build_cli.py` (step-only builds, ~50 s), and
`test_build_determinism.py` (two step+ifc builds, ~104 s). Without xdist they
run serially (~3 min). With `pytest-xdist -n auto --dist loadscope` they run
on separate workers in parallel (~1.5 min wall-clock).

Run only the applicable commands when the current environment or installed
toolchain cannot support an output. Report every skipped or failed command and
its reason.

### Full and E2E tier

Run the complete suite, site preparation, HTTP, viewer, or browser checks only
for broad cross-project changes, UI or site changes, minor or major dependency
upgrades, explicit full/E2E requests, or failures that require those checks for
diagnosis:

```text
python -m pytest -q
python -m pytest -q -m "e2e or viewer"
python-cad prepare-site --project-root . --destination site --base-path /file-template-cad/
```

The `integration` marker identifies artifact/export integration tests. The
`viewer` marker identifies viewer and local HTTP behavior. The `e2e` marker
identifies end-to-end tests that may require services, sockets, or browsers.

Classify `python-cad-tools` upgrades with semantic versioning. A change only to
the patch component (for example, `0.1.4` to `0.1.5`) uses basic tests and must
not run E2E tests. A minor or major change, or a user request for a full
upgrade, requires E2E testing. E2E testing is also available on demand through
the manually dispatched `File Template CAD End-to-End` GitHub Actions workflow.

The `python-cad-tools-upgrader` owns dependency upgrades. It must use its skill,
install only the published package, regenerate applicable locks, and run the
documented upgrade smoke sequence. It must not run E2E tests for patch-only
upgrades unless the user explicitly requests them.

Do not invent unsupported commands or silently bypass failed checks. Report
environment-specific skipped checks and the reason.

## Save and persistence

`save` is a skill available to every working agent; there is no separate save
agent. An agent may load it only after the user explicitly asks to commit or
save the changes to Git. Never infer this intent from task completion,
approval, a request to continue, or a generic request to save a file.

`specrepo-autocommit` performs automated commits and is only trusted inside a
real Git checkout on the user's local machine. Before invoking it, the agent
must confirm the working directory is a Git checkout
(`git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`) and that the environment is the user's
local machine, not an isolated, sandboxed, ephemeral, containerized, or remote
runner environment. When those conditions hold, the agent may invoke
`specrepo-autocommit` (or its command-line fallback) exactly once with the
supplied summary and explicit confirmation argument.

When the environment is not trusted, the agent must not invoke
`specrepo-autocommit` or its fallback. Instead it commits with plain Git
commands (`git add -A` and `git commit -m "..."`) exactly once from the
repository root. It must not push, amend, force, or retry automatically, and
must not fall back to `specrepo-autocommit` from an untrusted environment.

The user decides when work is ready to be committed. Agents must not assume it.
